Both general programming and specific TS rules live in this document

> if the rule can be formalized, be sure to think about writing a custom linter rule before adding it here

## General

## TypeScript

### Prefer union types over enums

-   [unions are type safe, flexible, and sometimes more powerful then enums](https://fettblog.eu/tidy-typescript-avoid-enums/?utm_source=typescript-weekly.com&utm_campaign=typescript_weekly_159&utm_medium=email)
-   [infer union from const array when you need both type and values array](https://steveholgado.com/typescript-types-from-arrays/)
